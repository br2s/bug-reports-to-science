# About

This repository is meant to help catalogue issues that have been identified in the research ecosystem, as well as potential or actual measures to address them. Feel free to use it to post your observations and ideas on how the research ecosystem could be improved. 

I am thinking of ways to turn this into something more actionable than just another bug list. Here too, your suggestions are welcome.
